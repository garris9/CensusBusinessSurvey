# Census Business Survey

#### Jesse Noss, Jeremy Garrison, Kendra Johnson

For our week 8 assessment, we reviewed the data contained on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) for 2019. The data is available [here](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/abs.2019.html). Of the four data sets, we focused on the Company Summary dataset, but have included code to access the other three.

After reviewing this data, we decided focus on these questions:

•	How do ownership demographics change across industry sectors?
•	Do the ownership demographics contribute to the size of a company? The size of a firm?
•	Is company revenue affected by their ownership demographics?
•	Which demographics existed in the data for comparison?

 Our goal was to explore the data and produce visualizations to answer these. We each took one set of demographics.

•	Male/Female - Jeremy
•	Veteran/Non-Veteran - Kendra
•	Race/Ethnicity - Jesse

Our work is seperated into folders with an additional folder containing our ETL report and visualization pngs.
